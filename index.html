			<h1> About Jude</h1>
			<p>I am the 21st cohort of the Deep Dive Code Academy. I am the Alpha and the Omega. I am infinite. I am eternal.
				I'm also beginning a new career in tech. My previous experience is in education, community planning and creating
				the known Universe. </p>

			<h2> Hobbies </h2>
			<p> In my spare time I like spending time with my dog, Buster, building in the garage and creating
				celestial bodies so large even I can't lift them. </p>

			<h4>Dog</h4>
			<p> I recently adopted a Westie Mix from a local shelter. Buster looks like a muppet and might be a Wauzer,
				a cross between a west highland terrier and a schnauzer. I also got him a big brother, Canis Major. Unfortunately,
			Canis is an outside only dog.</p>
